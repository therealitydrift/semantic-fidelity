# Semantic Fidelity

Semantic Fidelity is the degree to which meaning is preserved across compression,
translation, repetition, or abstraction.

The term describes how language, symbols, or representations can remain
technically correct while gradually losing alignment with the underlying
meaning they were intended to convey.
